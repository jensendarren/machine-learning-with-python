## Dealing with Real World Data

### Bias Variance Tradeoff

Essentially this is about overfitting and/or underfitting your model.

### Bias

How far from the 'real' answer are your results. If they are 'on target' then the bias is low and if they are all to one particular side of the target answer then the results can be said to have a bias.

### Varience

How scattered the predicted values are from the 'real' answer.

In many situations, you will find that you will need to trade bias vs varience by overfitting or underfitting your data.

So in the case of *underfitting* you may just have a straight line to represent a prediction of your dataset thereby having a *low varience* for the predictions and a *high bias* relative to each observation. 

In contrast, *overitting* the dataset you will join the data together thus have a *high varience* for the predictions and a *low bias* relative to each observation.
