# Machine Learning with Python Udemy course notes

These are my course notes for the [Machine Learning with Python Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) course.

### Course Notes

Download from the course notes from the [Sundog site](http://media.sundog-soft.com/Udemy/DataScience.zip). Extract these files somewhere useful for you on your local computer.

### Install Canopy

The best way to setup a Python development evnironment is to install [Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/). NOTE: On Mac you will need to open the Security Settings and allow the application to install since Apple by default will not allow anything to install that has not been downloaded via iTunes.

### Open Canopy Editor and install pydotplus

Open the Canopy Editor by clicking the Editor link in the Canopy Home Screen. In the Python console window type:

```
!pip install pydotplus
```
